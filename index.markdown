Today, the number of interconnected devices and the amount of personal information gathered by them increases tremendously resulting in the need for development tools to harness its potential. New devices are continually being introduced in the daily life of people, and they are already producing an unprecedented amount of data related to people's well-being. However, taking advantage of such information to create innovative Internet of Bodies solutions heavily relies on manually gathering the needed information from several sources on services and the devices involved. In this paper, we present a novel Human Data Model -- a new tool to combine personal information from several sources, perform computations over that information, and proactively schedule computer-human interactions. Developers that use the proposed model would obtain an opportunity to create the Internet of Bodies solutions using high-level abstractions of the users' personal information and taking advantage of the distributed approach of the model.
