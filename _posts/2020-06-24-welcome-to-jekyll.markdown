You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:


`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight js %}
var bob = {
    username: "bob",
    identity: "bob@hdm",
    companionUUID: "FB694B90-F49E-4597-8306-171BBA78F844",
    facebookID: "102684690214746",
    devices: {
        "5BF2E050-4730-46DE-B6A7-2C8BE4D9FA36": "bob@iphoneSE",
        "8B034F7B-FA9B-540F-ACF3-88C0CA70C84F": "bob@ibeacon"
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}
